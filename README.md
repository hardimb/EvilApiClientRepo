# EvilApiClientRepo
This repository is created to push evil api client code.

This program will take input of user name and csv file. User inputed name will be used to pass it in proprty parameter of API. Developed application will upload file and process file. 
I have implemented asynchronous api call.  I have also used task parallel library. I have also displayed runtime file processing result via signalR. There are many other ways to implement this requirement like we can save file processing result to database and invoke request for file processing result at certain intervals but it has drawback that it will increase server request and if multiple users are trying to use the application then it will increase server load.

Technology used :
Asp.Net MVC 5, Ninject, SignalR 

Notes :
I didnt implement test cases as it is demo application. 

Let me know if you need any further information.
